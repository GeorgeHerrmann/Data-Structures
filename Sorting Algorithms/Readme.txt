Name: George Herrmann

Provides an implementation for some common sorting algorithms as well as a driver class for them.

To Compile:
    - Type make into the console
To Clean:
    - Type make clean into the console
To Run:
    FOR EXPERIMENT 1 (providing input files)
        - Type ./main [FILENAME] where [FILENAME] is the name of the desired file to input.
          The program will then prompt you to input which sorting algorithm you would like to use.
        - EXAMPLE:
            - ./main random.txt
            - m
    FOR EXPERIMENT 2 (providing input size)
        - Type ./main into the console, nothing else. The program will then prompt
          you to input how many data members you'd like to sort, then which sorting algorithm you'd like to use.
        - EXAMPLE:
            - ./main
            - 500
            - m
